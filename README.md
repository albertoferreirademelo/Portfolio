# Welcome to Alberto's portfolio

###### This is a portfolio with some of my projects/study/tutorials from 2010 until today. In this repository you will find a mix of programs from different topics such as deep learning, k-means, website logins or even only a hello world. Follow me if you want and check out my weird journey :). PS. I have lost many of old projects since they only existed on the university server or on old hard drives but here are some programs that I could still find.
