# Welcome to Albertos portfolio

###### This is a portfolio with some of my projects/study/tutorials from 2010 until today. In this repository you will find a mix of programs from deep learning to only a hello world, so abrace yourself to a weird journey. :) 

I will save the programs that I have created or adapted to different projects I have done during my life. Sadly I have only started this project in 2020 which means that many of my old programs are only a memory in my head or are only partially done  and they are now laying in the void
